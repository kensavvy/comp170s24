# Assignment 04

Using the code we developed on Tuesday as a template, write two methods in class `A04.java` as follows:

* method `printOddCharacters(String string)` that prints only the characters found in odd positions of the specified `string`. For example, <br>
```printOddCharacters("Springfield");``` <br>
should return<br>
```p i g i l```

* method `printEvenCharacters(String string)` that prints only the characters found in even positions of the specified `string`. For example, <br>
```printOddCharacters("Springfield");``` <br>
should return<br>
```S r n f e d```

*Hint:* Keep it simple with `System.out.print`. The output of your methods must look like the output shown above, not like the output in the code we wrote on Tuesday.
