# Assignment 05

Write a method called `isPalindrome` that returns a `true` value when it is passed a string that reads the same from left-to-right and from right-to-left, and `false` otherwise. The method should work for single-word palindromes like *wow,* *racecar,* etc, and multi-word palindromes like *"A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"*.

Your cannot import any class (i.e., no `import` statements) and you cannot use *regular expressions*. (Imported tools and regular expressions are how most solutions online and in AI are implemented).

Your code must be well documented with comments. Method `A05.main` provides a simple testing environment.
